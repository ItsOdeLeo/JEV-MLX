# Preparing and publishing a release

[Back to home](../README.md)

JEV MLX is distributed as `jev-mlx`, imported as `jev_mlx`, and invoked with
the `jev-mlx` CLI. Version 0.1 artifacts can be prepared
locally without choosing an external account. Building a distribution does not
publish it. The local project directory
does not reserve a package name, and installation examples currently use the
source checkout or local wheel rather than PyPI.

The current source repository is [ItsOdeLeo/JEV-MLX](https://github.com/ItsOdeLeo/JEV-MLX).
Its checkout directory is `JEV-MLX`; the distribution, CLI, and import names above
are unchanged. A repository rename does not publish a package to a registry.

The latest evidence includes the completed three-model/four-method
[36-case warm comparison](extended-results.md), the separate
[original-suite Gemma tests and process cold start](gemma4-results.md), and
[161 passing core tests](../benchmarks/results/extended-release-checks/core-tests.json).
Gemma's additional extended cache phase completed 108 decisions and passed all
72 cached/fresh comparisons. The rebuilt wheel passed a fresh independent install
with MLX dependencies: all 14 runtime files match source and archive bytes, and
the public example selected `player.pause` in a real Gemma CLI call. See the
[wheel verification](../benchmarks/results/extended-release-checks/distribution.json).
Source-archive content checks and distribution hashes accompany local artifacts
in `dist/extended-v1/verification.json` and `SHA256SUMS`; that post-build record
is outside the source archive to avoid hashing itself. Historical wheel checks
remain separate records.
Benchmark completion and audit success do not imply correct model choices:
direct wrong enum actions were Gemma 1/30, Qwen 1/30, and GLM 8/30 on the extension.
Keep boolean classification metrics separate and preserve these failures in the
release notes.

## Verify release contents

1. Review the working tree, version in `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`, license,
   notice, README, changelog, model support, and results together.
2. Verify public, fictional provenance for fixtures and demonstration artifacts.
   Exclude usernames/private paths, credentials, model weights, environments,
   local caches, and unrelated application data.
3. Preserve upstream licenses/attribution. Project MIT licensing does not
   relicense dependencies or weights.
4. Run core tests/lint and appropriate opt-in model/parity checks for each
   checkpoint advertised as verified. Label failures and unrun checks.
5. Reproduce published benchmark cohorts with fixture/source/model identities,
   commands, hardware, every attempt, and failures. Match claims to evidence.
   Keep original and extended manifests separate, pass the correct `--fixtures-dir`
   to audits, and describe the extension's primary cohort as same-page only.
   Retain the separate completed Gemma cache phase and its parity evidence;
   do not imply that Qwen/GLM ran that phase on the extended suite.

```sh
python -m pytest -m 'not model'
python -m ruff check src tests benchmarks scripts
JEV_TEST_MODEL="$JEV_MLX_MODEL" python -m pytest tests/test_model.py
python scripts/check_parity.py --model "$JEV_MLX_MODEL" \
  --output results/release-parity.json
```

Parity tools record their own tolerances and decision-agreement checks. Report
the actual check and tolerance, rather than treating all cache tests as
equivalent. See [evaluation](evaluation.md).

## Build and inspect distributions

From a clean, reviewed checkout with `'.[dev]'` installed:

```sh
python -m build
python -m zipfile -l dist/jev_mlx-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
tar -tzf dist/jev_mlx-0.1.0.tar.gz
shasum -a 256 dist/*
```

The wheel must include the package, browser assets, typing marker, metadata, and
license material. The source archive should include the public documentation,
examples/tests, and benchmark tools needed for reproduction. Inspect archives;
a successful build alone does not verify their contents.

Test the absolute wheel path in a fresh environment outside the source checkout:

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/jev-wheel-check
/tmp/jev-wheel-check/bin/python -m pip install --no-deps \
  /absolute/path/to/dist/jev_mlx-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
/tmp/jev-wheel-check/bin/jev-mlx --help
/tmp/jev-wheel-check/bin/python -c \
  'from jev_mlx import __version__; print(__version__)'
```

Choose a fresh directory name if the environment already exists. On Apple
Silicon, install the wheel's `[mlx]` extra in a separate environment and run a
real decision against an explicitly chosen local checkpoint. Confirm packaged
demo assets load and model-selected DOM actions produce receipts. Linux core
CI cannot validate these GPU/browser behaviors.

## Publication requires an explicit destination

Before public push or upload, obtain the intended GitHub owner, repository name,
visibility, and authorized account/access. Before package upload, obtain the
registry, package-name availability, and authorized credentials or configured
trusted publisher. Do not infer destinations from local Git identity or the
account currently signed in.

Once destinations and publication authorization are supplied, review the exact
commit/artifacts, configure that remote, publish reviewed source, and create a
versioned release with wheel, source archive, checksums, changelog, and reproducible
results. Upload to a package registry only when that destination is authorized.
Record resulting URLs and immutable commit/tag in release notes.
Before registry upload, add the chosen public project URLs and resolve README
documentation/image links against that repository so they also render on the registry.

Until then, the complete local source, distributions, checksums, documentation,
and authentic demo evidence are the handoff. Do not invent repository URLs,
badges, successful CI runs, publication dates, upload results, or performance
numbers. The [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) distinguishes prepared from published.
