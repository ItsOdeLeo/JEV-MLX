</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Current state + a sentence → one allowed choice.</strong><br />Reuse an existing MLX model. No additional training.</p>

**JEV MLX** is an open-source Python library for local LLM action selection on Apple Silicon Macs, built with [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) and [MLX-LM](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm). It maps application state and a natural-language request to one of your allowed actions, or returns `no_match` / `abstain`. Use it for semantic routing, enum / boolean decisions, and language-driven application controls through a Python API, CLI, or local HTTP server.

**Use a compatible MLX-LM checkpoint you already have: no extra training, fine-tuning, or decision-specific weights.** The model processes the prompt normally; JEV MLX reads candidate logits at the final input position from its original output head. The weights and output head remain unchanged, and direct decisions require no generated continuation.

## A local model plays Blocks

![JEV MLX Blocks: complete 20-move development run, shown at 4× playback](docs/assets/blocks/preview.gif)

**Qwen3.5-9B · 20 model-selected placements · 4 cleared rows · 400 points.** The recording retains the former MLXJ name. The GIF shows the entire second development run at **4× playback**, including inference waits. The model chooses from every legal vertical-drop placement using structured board data and rule-computed outcomes; there is no best-move fallback. This is turn-based play, not screenshot understanding or frame-by-frame control.

[Run the game locally](docs/blocks.md) · [Full-speed video](docs/assets/blocks/full-run.mp4) · [All decisions](docs/assets/blocks/attempt-2.json)

The first attempt refused to place a piece. Both attempts are retained in the [game report](docs/blocks.md#recorded-development-attempts). After clarifying the game instruction, the second run reached its planned 20-piece limit. Its decision p50 / p95 was **5.78 / 11.57 seconds**; this is an illustrative development run, not a held-out game benchmark or a speed claim. Manual play can run on a static server; new AI decisions require the local MLX backend.

## MLX action selection and semantic routing

**JEV MLX** uses the current application state, a user utterance, and dynamic allowed choices to select a stable business ID with a local model. No-match and abstention are explicit outcomes.

Embed it in an existing tool: open a feature, select a visible item, pause a player, or answer a boolean / enum question. Inference runs on your Mac with an existing checkpoint; no training is required.

> **Project and package:** The project is JEV MLX. The distribution and CLI are `jev-mlx`, with Python imports from `jev_mlx`. Version 0.1 is experimental and has not been published to PyPI.

| Capability | What it means for your application |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic choices** | Update allowed actions with the page; keep your own stable business IDs. |
| **Explicit rejection** | Return `no_match` or `abstain` when an action is not appropriate. |
| **Version protection** | Reject stale decisions after state changes; consume execution authorization once. |
| **Prefix reuse** | Reuse stable context while evaluating every new utterance. Never cache final answers. |
| **Small integration surface** | Python API, CLI, and a localhost HTTP service. |

Models can make mistakes. Candidate scores rank choices and are **not calibrated probabilities of correctness**. State guards do not establish semantic correctness.

<a name="quick-start"></a>

## Quick start

Requires **Apple Silicon, native ARM Python 3.11+**, and a local MLX-LM checkpoint. Start with the verified Qwen checkpoint in the [model table](docs/models.md).

Clone the repository and install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ItsOdeLeo/JEV-MLX.git
cd JEV-MLX
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[mlx]'
export JEV_MLX_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/your/local/mlx-model
```

```python
import os
from jev_mlx import Candidate, DecisionRequest, MLXDecisionEngine

engine = MLXDecisionEngine(os.environ["JEV_MLX_MODEL"])
result = engine.decide(DecisionRequest(
    state={"focused_window": "notes"},
    utterance="Close it",
    candidates=(Candidate("close.notes", "Close the open notes window"),),
    state_version=1,
))

print(result.status, result.candidate_id)
print(result.margin, result.timing)
```

The CLI uses the same request contract:

```sh
jev-mlx decide --request examples/decision.json
```

Results include the candidate ID, raw logits, candidate scores, margin, state version, model identity, actual timing, and cache details. See the [Python API](docs/python-api.md) for booleans, state updates, and versioned execution.

## Measurements, with their limits

**New six-domain evaluation · Apple M2 Max · 64 GiB · 36 fictional English cases.**

Documents, calendar drafts, files, music queues, product comparisons, and settings. Three models receive the same frozen inputs, semantic prompt, and threshold, with four output methods each. These are the direct-scoring results:

| Local checkpoint | Exact decisions / 36 | Wrong actions / 30 | Same-page p50 / p95 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen3.5-9B-OptiQ-4bit | 30 / 36 (83.3%) | 1 / 30 | 194.8 / 407.5 ms |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B MoE | 31 / 36 (86.1%) | 1 / 30 | 168.9 / 556.5 ms |
| GLM-4.7-Flash-4bit | 21 / 36 (58.3%) | 8 / 30 | 170.6 / 330.5 ms |

The 36 cases contain 30 enum requests and six boolean decisions; action errors count enum requests only. **Timings require loaded weights and a reusable page prefix.** They do not describe startup or arbitrary new pages. See the [extended report](docs/extended-results.md) for every method, rejection and coverage rates, boolean quality, memory, and failures.

Gemma selected the wrong queue item; Qwen selected the wrong longest-battery product. GLM made more action errors. The earlier small sample's zero-error observation did not carry over to new cases. **These results do not establish reliable unattended actions, arbitrary-model compatibility, or fixed 100 ms performance.**

<details>
<summary><strong>Original 28 cases: previous results retained</strong></summary>

**Apple M2 Max · 64 GiB · 28 fictional English test cases · revised cache runtime.**

| Local checkpoint | Exact decisions | Wrong actions / enum requests | Same-page p50 / p95 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen3.5-9B-OptiQ-4bit | **25 / 28 (89.3%)** | **0 / 26** | **171.7 / 176.4 ms** |
| GLM-4.7-Flash-4bit | 14 / 28 (50.0%) | 2 / 26 | 147.8 / 170.6 ms |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B MoE · mixed 4/8-bit | 26 / 28 (92.9%) | 1 / 26 | 134.9 / 283.9 ms |

Accuracy includes 26 enum requests and two boolean decisions; action errors count enum requests only. These are separate recorded runs, not inputs to a cross-revision algorithm speedup claim. The [Gemma report](docs/gemma4-results.md) includes all four methods, three cache conditions, and every failure.

These timings require **loaded weights and a reusable page prefix**. Qwen's KV-cold p50 was **2,159.9 ms**; its first decision after a page update was **1,050.2 ms**. About 170 ms is not a per-request guarantee.

Qwen's three original-suite misses include rejection-status distinctions and a tied choice after reordering. Gemma selected the wrong filtered first item; GLM also produced incorrect actions. The original and extended sets are reported separately, not combined into one unseen-test score.

</details>

- **161 core tests passed:** contracts, state updates, stale decisions, single-use authorization, HTTP, and related behavior. These do not measure model semantics.
- **168 / 168 original-suite cache comparisons passed:** three models × 28 cases × two reuse conditions, each compared with fresh computation.
- **72 / 72 extended-suite cache comparisons passed:** Gemma's 36 new cases × two reuse conditions, with observed maximum logit and score differences of 0. Numerical agreement does not establish semantic correctness.
- **16 recorded browser scenarios checked:** actual DOM clicks and execution receipts. Decline cases accept either rejection outcome, unlike the strict quality set above.

<details>
<summary><strong>How was this tested?</strong></summary>

1. Write the original **16 dev / 28 test** cases and the separate **12 dev / 36 test** extension from scratch. Freeze their hashes; use no production exports. Version 0.1 validates English inputs only.
2. Freeze the original development-refined semantic prompt and threshold. This three-model campaign keeps them unchanged after seeing new test outputs.
3. Compare direct scoring, one-code generation, business-ID JSON, and option-code JSON. Retain every failed output.
4. Measure process startup, loaded weights with cold KV, a new utterance on the same page, and the first decision after a page update. Synchronize MLX work before stopping the timer.
5. Score model choice separately from execution. A guard blocking a bad action does not make the model correct.

Repeating 28 cases under several cache conditions does not create more independent samples. The historical one-code baseline reached 26/28, slightly better than the direct returned decision. Direct scoring did not dominate every quality and latency metric. A supplementary JSON-format experiment was informed by earlier test results and is explicitly labeled as such.

The [full report](docs/results.md) includes p50/p95, rejection, executable coverage, memory, versions, input sizes, reproduction commands, and original cache failures. Do not combine timings from different code revisions to calculate a speedup. See the [testing guide](docs/testing.md) for a step-by-step explanation.

## How a choice is made

```text
Application state + utterance + allowed choices
                       │
               Official MLX-LM model
                       │
           Final-position candidate logits
                       │
          selected(id) / no_match / abstain
                       │
       Application version check → execution → receipt
```

Choices map to tokenizer-verified single-token codes, then back to business IDs. Direct scoring reads a causal model's next-token logits without generating a JSON continuation. It retains the official quantized output head. Hybrid caches reuse only complete, valid prefix boundaries.

See the [architecture](docs/architecture.md) and [framework audit](docs/framework-audit.md). Version 0.1 focuses on **English, single-turn, single-step choices**. General chat, multi-step planning, arbitrary arguments, vision, training, and GPU batching are outside its scope. **Chinese documentation does not mean Chinese model behavior has been validated.**

## Related decision projects: OpenDecider and Laya

Developers evaluating **OpenDecider**, **Laya**, or **Laya-MLX** may also be looking for local action selection, classification, or semantic routing. **JEV MLX's main distinction is reusing an existing compatible causal MLX-LM checkpoint without extra training or separate decision-model weights.** Application-defined choices are scored through the original model output head.

## Frequently asked questions

### How does JEV MLX use MLX and MLX-LM?

MLX provides the array and compute framework; MLX-LM loads and runs the local language model. JEV MLX adds application-supplied choices, candidate scoring, rejection outcomes, and versioned execution. Direct decisions read next-token logits for verified single-token option codes without generating a JSON continuation. See the [architecture](docs/architecture.md).

The full model still processes the input. Reading final-position logits does not mean running only the final layer or replacing the output head.

### Can I use JEV MLX as a local semantic router?

Yes. Describe the currently allowed routes or actions as candidates with stable business IDs, supply the application state and user request, and inspect the selected ID. The host application defines and executes the actions. `no_match` and `abstain` handle unsuitable or ambiguous requests. See the [Python API](docs/python-api.md).

### How does JEV MLX compare with OpenDecider and Laya-MLX?

JEV MLX adds bounded action selection to existing compatible causal MLX-LM checkpoints without extra training or decision-specific weights. OpenDecider and Laya publish trained decision-model families, and Laya-MLX runs Laya weights. Their users can load published checkpoints without training them themselves. The distinction is which weights are required; APIs and score semantics also differ. See the [decision-model comparison](docs/decision-models.md).

### Which MLX models have been evaluated?

Recorded local checkpoints include Qwen3.5-9B-OptiQ-4bit, GLM-4.7-Flash-4bit, and Gemma 4 26B-A4B MoE. All three returned wrong actions in the 36-case extension. Evaluation of these checkpoints does not establish compatibility with every MLX model. Exact revisions, results, and limits are in the [model compatibility guide](docs/models.md).

### Does inference require a cloud API or model training?

Inference runs locally on an Apple Silicon Mac with an existing compatible MLX-LM checkpoint. No cloud API, extra training, fine-tuning, new decision head, or decision-specific checkpoint is required. If you already have compatible base weights, reuse them. Otherwise obtain those base weights separately and pass their local directory to the engine; the package does not download weights.

### How do I install JEV MLX?

Clone [ItsOdeLeo/JEV-MLX](https://github.com/ItsOdeLeo/JEV-MLX), create a native ARM Python 3.11+ environment, and run `python -m pip install -e '.[mlx]'` from the checkout. Set `JEV_MLX_MODEL` to your local checkpoint directory. Follow the [quick start](#quick-start) for a runnable example. Version 0.1 is experimental and has not been published to PyPI.

### How fast is local MLX action selection?

Latency depends on the checkpoint, hardware, input, and reusable prefix. The [measured results](#results) distinguish loaded weights with a reusable page prefix from startup, cold KV, and page updates. Warm measurements are not a fixed latency guarantee or evidence of reliable unattended execution.

### Is JEV MLX an official JEV implementation or a general chat assistant?

JEV MLX is an independent JEV-inspired project at [ItsOdeLeo/JEV-MLX](https://github.com/ItsOdeLeo/JEV-MLX). It uses existing MLX-LM models, not JEV weights, and does not reproduce unpublished JEV training. Version 0.1 supports English, single-turn, single-step choices; general chat, vision, and multi-step planning are outside its scope.
